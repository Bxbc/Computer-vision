### Knights and Knaves puzzle
#### General Description

Raymond Smullyan has designed many puzzles involving Knights and Knaves. Knights always tell the truth, whereas Knaves always lie. We refer to Knights and Knaves as Sirs. A puzzle, which is a set of English sentences, involves a finite number of Sirs. Solving the puzzle means:  

* determining the names of all Sirs involved in the puzzle;
* determining solutions to the puzzle, where a solution qualifies each Sir as either a Knight or a Knave.

Some puzzles have no solution, others have a unique solution, and others have at least 2 solutions. The following is an example of a puzzle with a unique solution.

	One evening as you are out for a stroll, you walk by a doorway labeled no normals allowed. Some people are talking inside. Curious, you listen, and you hear Sir Paul who says: "all of us are Knaves." "Exactly one of us is a Knight," replies Sir Jenny. As for Sir John, who is also inside, he just keeps quiet. Who is a Knight, and who is a Knave?
